					<p>It is usually assumed that a proper musical instrument is physical thing and that a proper recording will be a digital one. To play an instrument, we rearrange our fingers in real time. To play a recording, we press a single button to relate what was previously approximated.</p>

					<p>But what if there were not these distinctions? What if we blurred the lines between digital and physical, instrument and recording, program and composition?</p>

					<p>I blend these ideas by allowing users to physically compose - and simultaneously record - a melody by placing tuned aluminum rods around a rotating platform. The instrument/program can be played/ran by turning the small gear with one's finger. Four turns rotate the large gear once. With 16 available spaces, you could say that each turn is one 4/4 measure.</p>

					<p>For this iteration, I tuned each note to fall within the G major musical scale. So no matter one's arrangement, even beginners will enjoy their creation.</p>

					<p>I hope to design future versions that revisit the idea with perspective from composers, songwriters, and musicians of all experience levels. If you love music and have something to say, <a href='../index.html#contact'>send me a note</a>. Get it?! Ha ha. </p>
