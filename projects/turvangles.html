					<p>Turvangles - think "curved triangles" - are the sculpture you build yourself!
						Anyone can fit these interactive, connectable pieces together to create and recreate fine works of art.
						With 16 unique Turvangle shapes, the possibilities are limitless.</p>

					<p>(Okay, technically there's a limit <i>somewhere</i>.) Scroll down to see how I came up with 83 septillion!</p>

					<p>Did I say 83 septillion? Yep. (That's 83 trillion...<i>trillions</i> by the way.) Let's break it down:</p>

					<p>There are 16 mathematically unique Turvangle shapes with 3 connection points each - let's call them CP for short.
						Only one sculpture can be made from one shape. But what about two shapes?</p>

					<p>Since Turvangles are completely asymmetrical, there are 6 ways to add the second shape to any connection point on the first.
						3 original CP * 6 ways to add = 18 unique sculptures from two shapes.</p>

					<p>Adding a shape always adds 1 open CP to the sculpture, assuming each piece shares only one connection with any other piece and that no loops are formed.
						(In practice, some pieces <i>do</i> share two connections and loops <i>are</i> formed, but for the sake of simplicity we won't calculate this.
						It would only increase our total possibilities!)<sup>(1)</sup></p>

					<p>So let's say that the number of open CP is N+2, where N is the number of shapes.
						Our two-shape sculpture (one of 18 different versions) has 4 open connection points.
						6 ways to add the third shape * 4 places to add it = 24 total ways to add the third shape.
						But remember, that's 24 for each of the 18 possible two-shape sculptures!
						24 * 18 = 432 unique sculptures that can be built from just three shapes.</p>

					<p>If you want to keep doing math, just multiply unique sculptures * total ways to add until you've added the 16th.
						THDC<sup>(2)</sup> There are 83,619,443,946,597,434,523,648,000 possible sculpures that can be made from 16 unique Turvangle shapes.</p>
