					<p>Turvangles are interlocking pieces that connect to create any sculpture you could imagine! Okay, maybe not <i>any</i> sculpture,
						but there <i>are</i> some 83 septillion different possibilities. Let's try a little math fun:</p>

					<p>1. There are 16 unique Turvangle shapes with 3 connection points each (let's call them CP for short)</br>
						2. There are 6 ways to connect any shape to any CP (that's 3 CP of the connecting shape times 2 orientations)</br>
						3. There are 18 ways to add the second shape to the first (3 CP of the original shape times 6 ways to connect the new shape)</br>
						4. Adding a shape always adds 1 open CP to the sculpture (assuming each piece shares only one connection with any other piece)</br>
						5. This means there are always N+2 CP for the entire sculpture (a sculpture with 3 shapes would have 5 CP)</br>
						6. But we're not at three shapes yet! When the third shape is added, is has 4 possible CP to attach to from the current 2 shape sculpture</br>
						7. It also has 24 total ways to connect to the 2 shape sculpture (4 CP times 6 ways per CP)</br>
						8. But remember how there were 18 unique sculptures that could be created with just two shapes?</br>
						9. That means with three shapes, there are 24 times 18 unique sculptures - that's 432!</br>
						10. I'll spare you the rest of the math, but there are 83,619,443,946,597,434,523,648,000 (83 septillion) possible unique sculptures from 16 pieces.</p>
