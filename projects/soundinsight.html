					<p>Music is a compelling experience for many. It feels beautiful, organic, creative, and emotional.
						But we're not stopping there. From the science of sound waves to the patterns we tap our feet to,
						music can be described and explained mathematically.</p>
					<p>So what if we create a visual experience from the math that music is built on?
						take the math that Couldn't we then apply music's mathematical underpinnings to things like line and space to create
						Could we use this same math to express music visually?
						What then, could music <i>look</i> like using these same mathematical structures?</p>
						What would I get then if I
						Surely, these same mathematical propeties could be used to create a visual version of music?
						We could reverse engineer it. Surely music's mathematical stucture could be implemented visually.

					<p>All sound comes from waves that vibrate at different frequencies.
						The reason why certain vibrations sound like music at all has to do with the ratio between the frequencies.
						We usually like nice simple ratios, and in Western music, most instruments play a dedicated set of frequency tones.</p>

					<p>For example, an octave (like middle C and the C above it) Middle C vibrates at 261.6 Hz, and the C an octave above at 523.2 Hz.
						There is a 2:1 ratio here, which all octaves have. Think of it in the sense that
						you could fit two high Cs into one Middle C. Let's picture it:</p>

					<p>Other notes have other, slightly more complicated ratios like 2:3 and 3:4. For the 12 tones in an octave in
						Western music, each note has some relationship to all the other notes. When notes are played in sucession,
						it's called melody, and when played together it's called harmony. Either way, our brains interpret these patterns
						as music.</p>

						a note is the pitch and duration of a sound

					<p>You may know a bit about how music is written. The base note is typically a quarter note and is held out for
						1 count. In a whole note, there are, you guessed it, 4 quarter notes. Measures break music into phrases that all
						add up to the same amount of counts. If each measure has 4 counts, you could have a measure with 1 whole note,
						or 4 quarter notes, or 1 half note and 4 eight notes. Think of different slices of pie.</p>

					<p>For Sound Insight, I combined these two principles where each played note is an arc of a circle, where the radius
						corresponds to the reletave frequency, and the distance around the circumference to the fraction of the measure,
						assuming that a whole circle is one measure.</p>
