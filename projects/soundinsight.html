					<p>Music is a compelling experience for many. It feels beautiful, organic, creative, and emotional.
						We don't often describe math in the same way, but math is very good at describing music!
						So then, can we use the mathematic relationships present in music to compose a visual analogy?
						Sound Insight is my attempt.</p>

					<p>First of all, all sounds are vibrations. The reason some vibrations sound like music and others sound like
						just a bunch of noise has to do with the relationships between the frequencies of musical vibrations.
						Music is full of nice simple ratios that please our ears.</p>

					<p>For example, Middle C on the piano vibrates at at 261.6 Hz, while the C an octave above at 523.2 Hz.
						All octaves have this same 2:1 relationship. Since sounds are waves, exactly two high Cs could fit into
						the same physical space as one middle C. We can picture it like this:</p>

					<p>Other notes have other, slightly more complicated ratios like 2:3 and 3:4. For the 12 tones in an octave in
						Western music, each note has some relationship to all the other notes. When notes are played in sucession,
						it's called melody, and when played together it's called harmony. Either way, our brains interpret these patterns
						as music.</p>

					<p>You may know a bit about how music is written. The base note is typically a quarter note and is held out for
						1 count. In a whole note, there are, you guessed it, 4 quarter notes. Measures break music into phrases that all
						add up to the same amount of counts. If each measure has 4 counts, you could have a measure with 1 whole note,
						or 4 quarter notes, or 1 half note and 4 eight notes. Think of different slices of pie.</p>

					<p>For Sound Insight, I combined these two principles where each played note is an arc of a circle, where the radius
						corresponds to the reletave frequency, and the distance around the circumference to the fraction of the measure,
						assuming that a whole circle is one measure.</p>
