					<p>Music is full of numbers. From interesting harmonies to catchy rhythms, there's a ton of math behind the beauty.
						With all those numbers, could we translate music into something visual? Of course, music has been visualized before in many ways.
						Here's one of my favorites: <a>link</a>. Most of these are time-based, which makes sense because music is time bases.
						But could we transcend time with other physical proprties like space, distance, or size?</p>
					<p>So, how could I use music's mathematical structure to create a visual interpretation?
						I thought the relationship between pitches was the most important factor. Why do we hear certain combinations as pleasent or unpleasent?
						What makes a song distinct? It's pitches or frequencies of notes that make them sound different, and the relationships of these pitches
						make up the variety of combinations we hear as music.</p>
					<p>In an octave, for example, one note has exactly twice the frequency of another. It sounds like the same note, just higher.
						A 5th has a ratio of 1/3, and is the difference between the first and second "twinkle" of the little star.\
						Usually, it's simple ratios that sound nicer. A 1/23 ratio is more irregular and wouldn't sound as nice.</p>
					<p>The other factor was beat and rhythm, or how long each note is held out for</p>
					<p>So how could I represent these aspects in visual form? Sound Insight represents each note as an arc of a circle,
						where the radius of the circle corresponding to the pitch, and the distance around the circumference coresponding to
						how long the note is held for. In this way, a whole note would be a whole circle, a quarter note a quarter circle.
						The arcs are linked together tangentially</p>
					<p>This is from a particular song I wrote which you can listen to here: You can also listen to more here:</p>
					<p>This could also be a moving visualization. Anyone want to collaborate?</p>
