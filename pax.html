            <p>PAX Labs makes cannabis vaporizers that communicate with humans through motion sensing, haptic feedback, and a rich language of colorful LED animations.</p>
            <p>I came to PAX while behavior of Era Pro's user interface was still evolving. A typical week included last-minute feature requests and at least one new development build going out to internal testers. The goal of testing: Give employees the chance to evaluate the UX while squashing bugs before launch.</p>
            <p>But as I spoke with people across the company, what I noticed was that they were often unsure whether the device behavior they experienced was a bug or a legitimate part of the latest firmware update. This was a problem!</p>

            <p>I started meeting with firmware engineers and with Era Pro's lead PM in order to get a sense of the current development process and tensions within it.</p>
            <p>One pain point for engineers was that PAX had not yet hired a designer for device UX / UI, leaving them to interpret the PM's high-level product requirements into technical specifications themselves. Although UI documentation did exist, I learned that it was too vaguely worded and incomplete to be useful to the firmware team.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the PM's biggest frustration was the constant back-and-forth attempt to communicate what device animations should look like.</p>
            <p>As for the testers? I doubt the existing spec docs would've helped much had they known about them.</p>

          <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>To begin improving things, I knew there needed to be effective documentation at the heart of the process, and it needed to be useful to the firmware team.</p>
            <p>I spent more time with engineers, and had fun learning about the technological "how" behind Era Pro's interactive interface and animations.</p>
            <p>My initial documentation featured precise, technical implementation specs for each animation, written in a way that could also be used to specify proposed future animations. I called this system "frame code," but more on that later.</p>
            <p>The docs also included higher-level descriptions of user input behaviors and animation flows, so that anyone unfamiliar with code would still understand the intended interactions.</p>

            <p>When I gathered feedback on my "prototype" documentation, I learned that it worked well for the engineers, but not as much for those outside the firmware team. The issue? People needed to <i>see</i> the animations, not just read about them.</p>

          <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>In designing visual documentation, one thing I considered was how to account for animations inevitably changing through development, or with future products.</p>
            <p>To design for this while easing the product-firmware communication gap, I created a browser-based animation prototyping tool built to accommodate the same technical specs from the original documentation.</p>
            <p>This meant that anyone could input an animation's "frame code," and the tool would precisely show how that animation would look in the browser. This enabled product and firmware to have visual conversations and iterate quickly.</p>

          <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>Additionally, the tool was an effective way to generate visual documentation for the rest of the company.</p>
            <p>After adding animation gifs to the spec docs, testers could accurately report bugs and suggest UX improvements by comparing their device's behavior to the current build's documented interactions.</p>
            <p>I even got to use my prototyping tool to design a few animations of my own!</p>
            <p>Before launch, I authored and designed a user guide explaining Era Pro's many animations and interactions to consumers.</p>
