						<h3>The Weather Won't Decide Itself — a UX case study</h3>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/weather-five.png" alt="" /></span>
						<p><i>The Weather Won't Decide Itself</i> was my UX case study approach to designing a mobile app that
							walks users through the process creating their OWN weather. <a href="https://autumnbasinger.medium.com/the-weather-wont-decide-itself-a-ux-case-study-for-the-app-i-wish-i-had-98b347bde891">Read the unabridged version</a> on Medium!</p>

						<h3>Design process</h3>
						<p>Weather creation being a new and unusual experience,
							I started out with the research goal of discovering
							what kind of weather users wanted in the first place,
							and their general attitudes toward the idea of creating it themselves.</p>
						<p>I talked with 5 potential users between the ages of 25 and 56,
							and asked them, first, <b>"What is your preferred or ideal weather?"</b>
							and second, <b>"If you had one day to make the weather anything you want,
							what would it be?"</b></p>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/weather-affinity.png" alt="" /></span>
						<p>Based on my research, I created two personas to capture the goals and attitudes
							of different users who might suddenly encounter a DIY weather app on their smartphone.</p>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/weather-carly.png" alt="" /></span>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/weather-mark.png" alt="" /></span>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/weather-stories.png" alt="" /></span>
						<p>To get a sense of the competition, I investigated a few existing
							weather apps. Most of these apps, while thorough, provided more info
							than my users would probably <i>ever</i> care to fill in on their own.</p>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/weather-apps.png" alt="" /></span>
						<p>Going forward, I defined two product principles to help guide my design execution:
							First, <b>make the quickest path to perfect weather apparent</b> and second,
							<b>use familiar concepts and patterns to successfully guide users
							through an unfamiliar experience.</b> From there, I started using
							paper screens to quickly prototype initial ideas.</p>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/weather-paper.png" alt="" /></span>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/weather-testing.png" alt="" /></span>
						<p>Eventually through prototyping, the solution of "themes" emerged.
							Allowing users to select and edit weather themes would be a simple and
							effective way to balance guidance and freedom throughout the process.</p>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/weather-flow.png" alt="" /></span>
					</section>

					<section id="three">
						<h3>Final design</h3>
						<p>Upon entering the app, a user is prompted to select a theme.
							They may then customize it if desired, or else review and publish their weather immediately.</p>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/weather-first.png" alt="" /></span>
						<p>Users may add additional themes, switch out or delete themes.
							 Even when deleting themes, all customizations persist unless the user decides to reset the theme.</p>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/weather-add-switch.png" alt="" /></span>
						<p>Weather is set to happen in the user's current city the following day by default,
							but this can be customized to a date and location that the user chooses.</p>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/weather-cal.png" alt="" /></span>
						<p>Elements of a theme can be customized independently.</p>
						<center><span class="image half fit"><img src="images/weather-custom.gif" alt="" /></span></center>
						<p>Users can drag to reorder themes, and choose when their themes start and end.</p>
						<center><span class="image half fit"><img src="images/weather-edit.gif" alt="" /></span></center>
						<p>Happy weather creating!</p>
