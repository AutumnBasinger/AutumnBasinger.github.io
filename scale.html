						<h3>Content and visual design for Scale</h3>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/scale-logo.png" alt="" /></span>
						<p>Scale is a design and engineering consulting agency based in Palo Alto, California that helps hardware startups succeed from product strategy through to mass production. I designed Scale's informational one pager and refined their company logo.</p>

						<h3>The Process</h3>
						<p>Scale originally came to me wanting a quick-and-dirty logo refresh. After a few iterations, we arrived at something a little more subtle and visually compact.</p>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/scale-logos.png" alt="" /></span>
						<p>Shortly after, the company asked me to design a one-page PDF communicating the value that Scale brings to hardware startups. As this would be the first written or visual presentation of what Scale offers, I began meeting with the founders to understand their business model, target clients, the kind of work they do for startups, and what makes them stand out among competitors.</p>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/scale-brainstorm.png" alt="" /></span>
						<p>As we worked on creating a content strategy, it became clear that Scale’s unique working relationship with startups would be crucial to convey: While typical firms deliver on just a small piece of the development cycle, Scale oversees the entire project from start to finish, directly managing necessary third party partners on their client’s behalf.</p>
						<p>Because Scale cared most about content at this stage, I kept the visual branding simple by using icons from material.io and creating a straightforward color palette based on the original logo green.</p>
